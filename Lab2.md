# Functions Lab 2

### Lab Description :  
Write a program that takes user input for a math trick and prints the answer.

 

## Part One ::  In Main.py:

* Fill in the function trick1(num) with the following steps:

* Double num

* Add 6 to the answer

* Divide the answer by 2

* Subtract num from the answer

* Return the final answer

* The answer should always be 3! Call your function to test it out.

 
## Part Two :: In Main.py

* create a function called trick2 that takes a number as a parameter. Follow the steps in the sample output for Math Trick 2.

* Multiply the number by 3

* Add 45 to the answer

* Multiple the answer by 2

* Divide the answer by 6

* Subtract your original number from the answer


* The answer for this math trick should always be 15. Try it out by calling it a few times. 

 

## Sample Output :
