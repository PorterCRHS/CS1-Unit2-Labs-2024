# Functions Lab 3

## Part 1
* Create a function that calculates the area of a triangle (A = 0.5 x base x height)

* The function should be named area_triangle

* area_triange needs to take in two parameters (b and h)

* return the area of a triangle

## Part 2

* Create a function that calculates the volume of a rectangular prism.

* The function should be named prism_vol

* prism_vol needs to take in three parameters (b, h, l)

* return the volume



### Examples with optional user input:
```
Find the area of a triangle!
Enter in a base :: 3
Enter in a height :: 4
The area of this triangle with base 3 and height 4 is 6 units squared.

Find the volume of a rectangular prism!
Enter in a base :: 3
Enter in a height :: 5
Enter in a length :: 2
The volume of this rectangular prism with base 3, height 5, and length 2 is 30 units cubed.
